[Data Management](https://www.axiomdatascience.com/best-practices/index.html) plans help to ensure that your data are well-organized, managed, and prepared for preservation into the future. Use a data management plan to document the planned research effort, the expected outputs, and the plan for documenting and archiving data.

## File Structure

A successful [file structure](https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/broad/commkit/file-structure/) organizes your data and code with the goal of repeatability, making it easier for you and your collaborators to revisit, revise and develop your project. File structures are not fixed entities, but rather build a framework that communicates the function and purpose of elements within a project by separating concerns into a hierarchy of folders and using consistent, chronological, and descriptive names.
