## GitOps

[GitOps](https://www.weave.works/blog/gitops-operations-by-pull-request) is an operational framework that takes DevOps best practices used for application development such as version control, collaboration, compliance, and CI/CD, and applies them to infrastructure automation.

GitOps uses Git as a single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications. GitOps uses Git pull requests to automatically manage infrastructure provisioning and deployment. The Git repository contains the entire state of the system so that the trail of changes to the system state are visible and auditable.

Weaveworks is credited with creating the term GitOps.
