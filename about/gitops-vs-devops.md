[GitOps](https://www.weave.works/blog/gitops-operations-by-pull-request) is a specific system operations process (ops) tied to a specific tool (Git). It is an evolution of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and a DevOps best practice that uses Git as the single source of truth and control mechanism for building, updating, and deleting the system architecture.

GitOps is the practice of using Git pull requests to validate and automatically deploy changes to system infrastructure.

Weaveworks is credited with creating the term GitOps.
