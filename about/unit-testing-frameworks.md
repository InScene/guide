## Embunit

[Embunit](https://www.embunit.com/) is an open source unit testing framework for embedded software in C or C++ for programmers and testers developing software. It is aimed at embedded software development, but can be used to create unit tests for any software written in C or C++.

## pytest

The [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/) framework allows to write small, readable tests, and can be scaled to support complex functional tests for applications and libraries.
