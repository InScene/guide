# Conventional Commits

The [Conventional Commits](https://sentenz.github.io/backup-service/website/conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/index.html) specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages. It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history; which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of.

This convention dovetails with [SemVer](https://sentenz.github.io/backup-service/website/semver.org/index.html), by describing the features, fixes, and breaking changes made in commit messages.
